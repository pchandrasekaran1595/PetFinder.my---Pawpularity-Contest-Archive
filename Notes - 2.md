- **Full CNN Models** <br/>
    1. Train only the final Layer. Then finetune by training entire model.
    2. Train entire model from scratch.

- Analyze Pretrained features using (MSELoss + L1Loss).

- Perform ML Analysis on extracted features.

- Test Features from all Models. Find Best (Currently assumes D169)

- Shorlisted Models (ResNet-101, ResNext-101, Wide-ResNet-101, Densenet-169, Densenet-201) *[32, 5e-4, 1e-1]*

- Test all Efficeint Nets.
